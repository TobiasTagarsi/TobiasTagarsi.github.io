                            <p>A Project that was inspired by the game Startopia. It uses Unity's built in AI pathfinding tools to have sentient shapes (aliens) walk about a space station, while the user 
                                creates facilities to fulfil the needs of each alien. The alien's needs are slowly depleting bars such as hunger. To facilitate some needs,
                                the user must also hire aliens to work at the facilities. The user can place down facilities where they want, and the pathfinding system will guide the aliens to
                                the correct locations. The user has a choice of different sized facilities. The project was built to showcase my ability to use Object Orientation Programming 
                                techniques and teqniques such as builders and factories.

                                which I then used to create buttons to be pushed in regular intervals. Failing to push the button results in the game ending. The challenge with this project was getting the buttons to work
                                correctly with the hand-tracking collision physics.

                            <p>The AR software itself is third-party. Group work: I was the programmer in a team of 3 user experience designers (UX) and 1 game designer. I worked with the game designer to produce an prototype artefact based on the 
                                UX's work, as well as implement the game designers' game. There are two sections, a free-roam AR game and a target based AR information application. The target info-app
                                displays models of the Tower of London and provide historical information using a phone's camera and target image. The game section allows the user to select the ground near them with 
                                a phone's camera, which then creates a world around them to explore by facing a direction and tapping the screen. By interacting with non-controllable characters, the player obtains hints
                                of locations to visit, providing both a means of direction and a platform to teach and show historical information/sites.

                                the food sources. As the agent moves around it marks how useful the tiles are based on where it has already been and where the food is. After multiple iterations the agent learns where the food can be found.

                            <h3 class="subheading mb-2">Games Programming</h3>
                            <p>Creating games with C#; Kingston taught me how to construct and manage Unity games. Through these modules I strengthened my object orientation programming and learnt a lot about C#:
                                 how to use interfaces, enumerators and continue to bolster my knowledge of inheritance, and understand C# specific classes, like sealed which is used to prevent inheritance.
                                  Eventually, I learnt how to implement builders, factories, and construct libraries.
                                  I have also had lectures and help in understanding programming skills, such as multithreading and optimising code through big O notation.
                                </p>
                            <h3 class="subheading mb-2">Interactive Media</h3>
                            <p>With Unity, I learnt how to develop using virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). 
                                Through implementing third-party software, I experimented with hand tracking and AR tracking, 
                                creating both a solo button game, and history information application through teamwork.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="subheading mb-2">Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a focus for my studies at both Hertfordshire and Kingston. Many of my modules covered this topic and so I learnt a lot about learning algorithms, 
                                complexity through simplicity, robots and automata, and neural networks. 
                                From creating code for robots to achieve a goal, to using a network to predict images, 
                                all my work through my AI modules has taught me how to overcome challenging and thought provoking problems.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="subheading mb-2">Development Exercises</h3>
                            <p>Both universities have provided me with group projects, helping me become a better team member and fully contribute the best I can when involving others. 
                                Through creating a joint website and history app 
                                and making use of source and management control such as Git and Trello, 
                                I am confident in my ability to adapt to different teams and assimilate the knowledge needed to succeed.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="subheading mb-2">Security, Networks, and Linux</h3>
                            <p>Learning Linux to then use as a platform for networking and security was a great challenge, both being fields which 
                                I had never touched on before, and ultimately proved a rewarding experience. In the end, each field combined for a 
                                final module project about hacking into a network and retrieving information.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="subheading mb-2">Low level programming</h3>
                            <p>Some of the most fun work I’ve done was during my Platforms module at Hertfordshire. Learning machine code, assembly language, and circuitry. Logic has always been a great interest of mine and 
                                is a main inspiration for taking up programming 
                                modules and degrees. A highlight of this module being the group work to construct the classic Pong table tennis game using circuity – I was in chare of creating the AI and fixing a few bugs.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="subheading mb-2">Ethics and Human Development</h3>
                            <p class="mb-5">An important aspect of my time at university was spent learning about the impact of computing and the ethics involved, as well as how copyright can impact a project. 
                                From case studying Edward Snowden to the uses of copyright, these modules helped me get a better understanding 
                                of how the tech industry operates and interacts with the wider world.</p>
